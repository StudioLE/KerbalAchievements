## Install

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/StudioLE/KerbalAchievements.git KerbalAchievements
```

Enter the directory and install the dependencies. For this step you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) installed.

```
cd KerbalAchievements
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.

The app is now ready. To reach it you can either point your webserver to the directory:

```
KerbalAchievements/app
```

Or you run the bundled node dev server which will launch the app to `http://localhost:1337`

```
npm start
```
